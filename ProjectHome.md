> This calculator is designed to allow for the computation of non-trivial mathematical  expressions.  The project started out as figuring out how to calculate a definite integral without using applications like matlab or octave.  The intention of this project now is to include some general use applications: definite integral calculator, solving linear equations, etc... Without the overhead of a scripting language or a full blown application.  This calculator is designed so that it can run as a stand alone application or embedded in a web browser for students to use as they are working through calculus and linear algebra classes. There is a live version running at [calc.begin-programming.com](http://calc.begin-programming.com).  Currently only integrals, derivatives and general scientific calculations can be performed.
