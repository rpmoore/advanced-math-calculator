= Standards =

There are a few standards when it comes to the code that will be accepted into the project.

They include:
    * Code must have unit tests and they must be added to the master unit test framework inside of unitTesting/MainTestSuite.java
    * Every public method should have javadoc associated with it. (Yes not all of the code has javadoc.  We are working on it!)
    * Code should be able to compile before being checked in.  If code does not compile the commit will be backed out.
    * If you want to add a new major feature, create a branch for it and do the development there.
    * There is not standard as to how the code needs to be formatted.  IE it does not matter which line the opening curly brace goes on.
